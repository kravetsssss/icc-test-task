# Task

ICC (https://play.chessclub.com/) is a player versus player (PvP) chess platform
that matches players based on their chess game ratings. Each player has ratings
for different game types: bullet, blitz, rapid, and classic (games lasting more than
30 minutes). Each game type has its time controls. For example, "blitz 3+2"
means a 3-minute game with a 2-second increment (each player gains an extra 2
seconds on their clock after every move).

Player information is represented as follows:
```
{
id: , //unique identifier
name:
bullet_rating:
blitz_rating:
rapid_rating:
classic_rating:
}
```

Pairing requirements:
User flow:
The user clicks one of the game buttons (refer to the screenshot below). When
the user clicks on a button, a pulsing animation appears on the corresponding
button, indicating that the system is searching for an opponent for the user within
that specific time control. A second click on the same button cancels the request.
When an opponent is found, the user starts a game with the chosen opponent.

Requirements:
1. Users can have multiple pairing requests.
2. Users can create or cancel requests at any given moment.
3. Users can only be paired/play with one user at a time.
4. Users are free to be paired again only when their previous game has
ended.
5. Users will be paired with other users within a +-150 rating for the
corresponding game type rating.
6. All users starts with 1500 ratings in all game types

Assumptions:
1. The chess logic already exists, and once we find a pair, the users are
directed to another service called "game-service" where they can play the
game.
2. When the user win or lose a game its rating is going up or done 10 points.
Design a system to pair users based on the given requirements. Your design
should include data structure design, APIs/Endpoints, and diagrams to explain
the design.
